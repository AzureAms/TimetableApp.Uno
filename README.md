# TimetableAppTimetable management and automatic online class joining. Created for the Uno Platform, which works on all your devices.## Try it online:![WASM screenshot](Images/WASM.png)## Screenshots:![UWP screenshot](Images/UWP.png)  ![Android screenshot](Images/Android.png)## Data format: The application downloads the timetable from a URL, provided by the organization. The URL must lead to a JSON file, with this format:```{     "MD5":"MD5 of real timetable file, for validation.",     "Location":"https://example.com/url-to-real-timetable-file"  }```The real timetable file MUST be in this format:```{   "Name":"Name of timetable",     "UpdateURL":"Where to check for the next version",     "Lessons":[          [],          [                 {                   "StartTime": "07:30:00",                     "EndTime": "08:10:00",                     "Credentials": {                         "$type": "TimetableApp.Core.Zoom.ZoomCredentials, $ASSEMBLY_NAME",                         "ID": "room-id",                         "Password": "password"                         },                     "Subject": "subject name",                     "TeacherName": "your teacher here",                     "Notes": "",                     "AdditionalTags": {}                     },          ]     ]  }  ```### Remarks:- `StartTime` and `EndTime`- `$type` for Credentials is the credentials class you want to use. Currently, we only support Zoom credentials.- `$ASSEMBLY_NAME` will be internally replaced with the application's assembly name. This is used for compatibility with old versions of the app (Timetable.NET), and with the generator.- `AdditionalTags` is a `Dictionary<string, string>`, which contains custom properties. ## Upcoming plans:  - Support for Windows 7 (using WPF) and for Linux (GTK). We are not currently supporting these platforms because Uno's renderers are currently under development.- Support for iOS: Currently not provided because I don't have any Apple devices to test on! You can still build for iOS from source, of course, if you have a Mac or an iPhone.- Timetable Editor: We will create this if the project gets more popularity, as not many teachers know JSON!- Custom credentials: Currently, our users only use Zoom for online classes. Extensions might be done on user request.
